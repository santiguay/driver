    The following list describes items restricted in this version and how to 
    deal with problems.  Also, please be sure to refer to the warnings of the 
    "User's manual" and "Application Development Guide GENERAL DEVELOPMENT".
     - 6.1 Installation and uninstallation
     - 6.2 Interface connection
     - 6.3 Devices
     - 6.4 Others

6.1 Installation and uninstallation
    1) While operating the Installer with a keyboard, the back screen may 
       switch to a screen that is unable to operate with a keyboard after an 
       error message or caution.
       In such a case, please depress <Alt + F6> and switch the screen.
    2) If a device that is not supported is already registered in the 
       environment where this version will be installed, registration 
       information for the unsupported device must be deleted.  Please delete 
       the registration information prior to installing this version.  If this 
       version is installed without deleting this information, the registration
       information will be deleted during installation.
    3) When installing alongside one of the older versions(Ver1.60 - Ver1.95),
       please be sure to install the older version prior to installing this
       version.
    4) When uninstalling in an environment with other versions(Ver1.60 - Ver1.95),
       please run this version's uninstaller.
    5) There is an unresolved issue with the OPOS ADK version 2.60 uninstaller.
       Therefore, when uninstalling the OPOS ADK version 2.60, please uninstall
       after installing this version.
    6) When uninstalling OPOS after doing an upgrade install, it's possible
       that there may still be some remaining empty folders inside the
       installation folder. If desired, these empty folders can be deleted.
       Note that if these empty folders are not deleted it will not have any
       effect on the operation of the driver.
    7) Please restart your system after upgrade install When installing by silent
       from the older versions(Ver.2.68 - Ver.2.80)

6.2 Interface connection
6.2.1 Parallel connection
    1) We checked the performance of the program at LPT1.
    2) Please set "Bi-Directional" for either the ECP or EPP settings in the 
       parallel mode settings in the BIOS.
    3) Depending on the BIOS, there is a possibility of "ECP doesn't work but 
       EPP does work" or conversely "EPP doesn't work but ECP does work" 
       occurring. If it doesn't work properly, please change these settings 
       and try again.
    4) After turning the device off, there is a delay of several seconds 
       before the ServiceObject recognizes that the power is off. Please 
       consider in the application.
    5) When registering a device in SetupPOS and using the device in a 64bit 
       OS environment, and if the model does not use the "TMPORT" port type, 
       the device will be supported by the Windows' standard parallel driver.
       In this case, there are the following limitations:
        - Monitoring of power functions is not supported.
        - Using commands to clear recoverable errors is not supported. Remove 
          an error state by power supply OFF/ON.
        - It is not possible to open the cash drawer when the printer is in 
          an error state.
          Open the cash drawer after an error state is removed.
        - If the printer (Parallel model) is connected to the PC, a "Found 
          New Hardware" dialog will be displayed with the title "Windows 
          needs to  install software for your EPSON TM-P X.xx".
          Since it is not necessary to install the driver, search for the 
          driver using the "Locate and install driver software (recommended)" 
          option.
          Press the "Close" button after Windows indicates that it is unable 
          to locate the driver. Once this is done, the message will no longer 
          be displayed.

          * If the [Cancel] button is pressed to close the dialog, the same 
            message will be displayed next time the device is connected.

6.2.2 USB connection
    1) We checked the performance of the program, connecting with a maximum of 
       10 printers via the USB interface.
    2) When device which use a "TMPORT" are registered in SetupPOS, please
       create the USB TMPORT with the "TMPORT Making" dialog before turning
       on the device. 
       If the device is turned on before the port is created, it's possible 
       that the device will not be connected to the desired port. 
    3) If the "Found new hardware wizard" is displayed when the printer is 
       turned ON/OFF, cancel the wizard and install the EPSON Advanced Printer 
       Driver (Version 4.50 or later). 

6.2.3 Network connection
    1) We checked the performance of the program, connecting with a maximum of 
       20 printers via the network interface.
    2) Please exercise caution to the following points when using the Network 
       Interface Device.
        - During use the OPOS driver, the TM printer's power Off / On operation
          is supported, but after it is turned On, it cannot be guaranteed that
          it will reconnect, so exercise caution. During use the OPOS driver, 
          that PC has a monopoly on its connection with the TM printer. (Another
          PC cannot connect with it.) However, if the TM printer's power is 
          turned OFF once, then turned On again, any PC existing on the 
          network can connect with that TM printer. At that time, the OPOS of 
          a PC which is in the middle of a Claim will attempt to reconnect 
          automatically, but if another PC's OPOS also attempts to make a 
          Claim, it is not clear which will be able to make the connection. 
          The PC which is the earliest to request connection can establish the 
          connection. Accordingly, a TM printer which has had its power turned 
          Off and On after Open and Claim, may not necessarily be available to 
          reconnect to, so exercise caution.  When the TM printer's power is 
          turned On.
        - It can take up to maximun 20 seconds when turning on or resetting a
          TM printer, or using a network function.  Please wait for this
          interval to pass before starting any processing.
6.2.4 Bluetooth connection
    1) After turning off TM printer power, wait at least 20 seconds before 
       turning power back on. The printer will not print if power is turned 
       on before this time has elapsed.
    2) When the power supply of a printer is Off, if a Claim method is 
       performed,before a response will return, it will take 7 seconds or more.

6.3 Devices
6.3.1 POSPrinter
    1) Multi-tone printing:
       There are following two ways for gray scale printing:
       - PrintBitmap
         Set to "Multi-tone" from SetupPOS [Device Specific Settings]->
         [Color Bitmap]->[Gradation Method], or, Change the mode by DirectIO
         method (DI_SET_BITMAP_PRINTING_TYPE)
         For your information, white line might be seen in the print result when
         gray scale printing via serial or Ethernet interface. Also, printing
         speed might be slower.
       -NVRAM
         To register images in the NVRAM, it is necessary to register the image
         by the utility software at first, then print by DerectIO method
         (DI_PRINT_FLASH_BITMAP2).
    2) Data sent from the printer after OPOS is used
       Device settings are overwritten once OPOS is used.  Depending on this 
       action, data could subsequently be sent from the device.  If you then 
       directly connect to the device without using OPOS, please disregard the 
       following data.
        - 3-byte printer status sent when the power is turned ON
        - 3-byte power ON notification sent when the power is turned ON

6.3.2 CheckScanner
    1) Do not touch the CheckScanner device when scanning image data.
       In particular, do not turn the power OFF/ON during scanning.  Problems 
       with the operation of ServiceObject may occur.

6.3.3 HardTotals
    1) Hard Totals using EPSON series NVRAM needs a driver to access the NVRAM:
       EPSON NVRAM Driver.  In an environment where the EPSON NVRAM Driver is 
       not installed, Hard Totals cannot be installed.  To install Hard Totals 
       onto a machine on which you are going to use the EPSON NVRAM Driver, 
       install the driver first.  For how to purchase the EPSON NVRAM Driver, 
       check with the company where you bought the IM hardware.

6.3.4 KeyLock
    1) If you try to use the function in Windows2000, OPOS can't detect the 
       keylock position correctly.  Therefore, the keylock function of the 
       DM-KX060 (which is an optional keyboard for the ARCX(IM-700)/URBANII(SR-
       610)) is not available.

6.4 Others
    1) Stand by/hibernation mode for the OS
       Since it is possible that the driver will become unstable if the 
       computer goes into stand by/hibernation mode while the printer is in 
       use, please avoid the use of stand by/hibernation mode.
    2) OS upgrade
       When you upgrade OS in the environment where driver is already installed, 
       devices must be re-registered after upgrade of OS is complete.
    3) Sample program
       When using the EPSON OPOS ADK for TM-T88V Version 1.24E:
       Please exercise caution when updating/reinstalling this release:
        - The Oposepsn.bas file has been upgraded.
        - The definition names have been changed at the step 19.
          [Before]               [After]
          PTR_DI_NORMAL      ->  PTR_DI_BITMAP_PRINTING_NORMAL
          PTR_DI_MULTI_TONE  ->  PTR_DI_BITMAP_PRINTING_MULTI_TONE
    4) The location to save the log files
       The default location to save the trace log file and POSPrinter error 
       log files is as follows:
