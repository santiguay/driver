3. Installation and uninstallation
    Follow the procedures in "EPSON JavaPOS ADK Installation Guide" for
    installation and uninstallation.

    In Linux, Please refer to the
    "EPSON JavaPOS ADK Installation Guide for Linux.txt" for downloads 
    and detailed installation instructions.

    Note that cancelling or abruptly terminating the installer during file
    installation could put the system in a state where further installation
    cannot be completed. In order to install JavaPOS in this situation, use
    the "Forced Uninstall" option and then run the installer again.  If the
    process is cancelled while the "Forced Uninstall" options is used, it's
    possible that the system remain in a state where further re-installation
    cannot be completed. In this case, use the "Forced Uninstall" option again.

    When running the installer on a system where JavaPOS was previously
    installed, it is necessary to install to the same location.  If JavaPOS is
    installed to a different location, previous settings may inhibit correct
    operation.  In order to install JavaPOS to a different location in this
    case, use the "Forced Uninstall" option to clear all previous settings
    before running the installer.

    Chapter 7.4 has the following sentence.
    "In order to communicate with USB, please install libusb before 
     installing JavaPOS."
    But it must install libusb before installing JavaPOS to communicate
    with all interface connection.


4. Support devices
    Please refer to "SupportedDevicesList.txt" for details.

5. Notes of JavaPOS
5.1 Installation and uninstallation
     1) When installing the software, create a folder with the name 
        "epson\pos" in the following directory.

        Windows
           Windows 2000/XP/Embedded:
            <System Drive>:\Documents and Settings\All Users
           Windows Vista or newer:
            <System Drive>:\ProgramData
        Linux
         /var

        Temporary files and information files required by DeviceService 
        operations are saved in this "epson\pos" directory. Do not delete this
        directory.
     2) If you select "Custom" for the install type and execute installing, do 
        not specify the root directory ("/") for a shortcut folder. The 
        shortcut folder will not be created. (Linux Only)
     3) For installation, a restart is required when the "msvcr71.dll" file is 
        copied to or updated in the \WINDOWS\System32\ directory, or if a file 
        to be installed by the installer is in use at install time.
     4) For uninstallation, a restart is required when a file to be uninstalled 
        by the uninstaller is in use at uninstall time.
     5) Installer and Uninstaller were able to start for the second time.
        However, this action is not supported.(Linux only)
     6) There is a known issue with the uninstaller following an upgrade 
        installation where the uninstaller will be unable to remove all 
        installation directories. For default installation directory locations, 
        the "/opt/EpsonJavaPOS" directory will not be removed by the uninstaller
        on Linux systems; the "C:\Program Files\Epson\JavaPOS" and
        "C:\Program Files\Epson" directories will not be removed by the
        uninstaller on Windows systems. You can manually delete these
        directories after the uninstaller runs to completion.
     7) If you select "Custom" for the install type and change the location 
        where to install the services of JavaPOS, you cannot start up the 
        CheckHealth tool from the shortcut of the CheckHealth tool created by 
        the installer. In that case, follow the instructions below to correct 
        the Shell script (or batch file) that is the basis of the shortcut.
     8) After installing on Linux, there may be a 
        "java.lang.NullPointerException" error with the "RPMSpecFile" indicated
        in the installer log file (Details: 
        "ERROR - There was a problem creating the RPM package. You may not be 
        running as root or may not have installed RPM Builder correctly."). 
        This is an RPM issue and does not affect the operation of the ADK.
     9) Classpath setting
          Jar files in the directory where services of JavaPOS are installed that
          require setting for Classpath.
    10) Please restart your system after upgrade install When installing by silent
        from the older versions(Ver.1.11.20 - Ver.1.13)

5.2 Interface connection
5.2.1 USB connection
     1) multiple models of the same type:
      If multiple models of the same type are used in USB connections at the 
      same time, settings must be configured manually(See "5.2.1.1 Procedure").
      Note that the procedure varies by model.
    
      Windows : TM-H5000II/TM-H5200/TM-J2000/TM-J2100/TM-J7000/TM-J7100/
                TM-J7500/TM-J7600
5.2.1.1 Procedure
      1) Set the USB port setting [Port Name Type] to [Serial Number]. 
      2) Specify the USB serial number as the port name.
      
      The USB serial number is a serial number provided exclusively for USB. 
      The USB serial number can be checked with the following procedure.

      - Perform a printer self-test print.
        Generally, if the printer is turned on with the printer cover closed 
        and the FEED switch held down, self-test printing is performed on roll 
        paper.
      - The serial number can be identified from the print results. 
        When the print results are in format a), the part shown as "ID" is 
        the USB serial number (in the example below YYYYYYYYYYYYYY is the 
        serial number). When the print results are in format b), the USB 
        serial number is the same as the printer serial number. In this case, 
        check the label attached to the printer.

        a) When the USB serial number is printed
          ----------
              :
          Firmware Version X.XX ESC/POS

          Interface UB-UXXXX Ver.X.XX
           ID  :YYYYYYYYYYYYYY
              :
              :
          ----------

        b) When the USB serial number is not printed
          ----------
              :
          Firmware Version X.XX ESC/POS

          USB Interface or other
              :
              :
          ----------

          * "USB Interface or other" shown above may be printed simply as
            "USB Interface."

    Note that when setting the device using this method, changing a device
    with a different USB serial number, requires changing the SetupPOS
    settings.

    Note that on Linux When using the Serial Number as the Port Name Type
    for a USB connection, only the first 17 characters of the Serial Number
    should be entered in SetupPOS.

    If the "Found new hardware wizard" is displayed when the printer is 
    turned ON/OFF, cancel the wizard and install the EPSON Advanced Printer 
    Driver (Version 4.50 or newer). (Windows only)

5.2.2 Bluetooth connection
    1) After turning off TM printer power, wait at least 20 seconds before 
       turning power back on. The printer will not print if power is turned 
       on before this time has elapsed.
    2) When the power supply of a printer is Off, if a Claim method is 
       performed,before a response will return, it will take 7 seconds or more.

5.3 Devices
5.3.1 POSPrinter
    1) Multi-tone printing:
       There are following two ways for gray scale printing:
       - PrintBitmap
         Set to "Multi Tone" from SetupPOS [Device Details]->[Gradation], or,
         Change the mode by DirectIO
         method (DI_SET_BITMAP_PRINTING_TYPE)
         For your information, white line might be seen in the print result when
         gray scale printing via serial or Ethernet interface. Also, printing
         speed might be slower.
       -NVRAM
         To register images in the NVRAM, it is necessary to register the image
         by the utility software at first, then print by DerectIO method
         (DI_PRINT_FLASH_BITMAP2).
    2) Data sent from the printer after OPOS is used
       Device settings are overwritten once OPOS is used.  Depending on this 
       action, data could subsequently be sent from the device.  If you then 
       directly connect to the device without using OPOS, please disregard the 
       following data.
        - 3-byte printer status sent when the power is turned ON
        - 3-byte power ON notification sent when the power is turned ON
    3) You may not print when a printing is performed immediately after you open
       the cover and close the cover quickly twice.

5.3.2 Keylock
    1) Although the SetupPOS function was documented in the DM-KX060 manual,
       this setting is not included to the current SetupPOS. "KeyPosition
       Compatibility Mode" will be set "UPOS Specification".

5.3.3 LineDisplay
    1) MarqueeRepeatWait and MarqueeUnitWait property:
       When setting MarqueeRepeatWait or MarqueeUnitWait below 300msec with DM-D30,
       it'll be 300msec.

5.4 Others
    1) Stand by/hibernation mode for the OS
       Since it is possible that the driver will become unstable if the 
       computer goes into stand by/hibernation mode while the printer is in 
       use, please avoid the use of stand by/hibernation mode.
    2) The right of access to data (Linux only)
       To store the necessary information, JavaPOS creates a directory called
       "/var/epson_javapos/pos". Set the access rights of the "/var/epson_javapos/pos"
       directory, all sub directories, and all files so JavaPOS-using users
       are allowed to write.
    3) The Drag & Drop function in SetupPOS requires GTK 2.10.4 or newer.
    4) When SetupPOS is launched through a terminal on SLED 11 environment,
       GTK-warning will be displayed. 
       However the operation of SetupPOS will not be affected. 
    5) The logo utility (TMFlogo, etc.)
       The logo utility is not in this package. For uploading logo data to 
       nonvolatile memory, please use SetBitmap method, or please obtain the
       logo utility.
    6) Sample program
       - When you use the sample program, the Login ID needs to be the 
         Administrator account group.
       - Register with the logical device name.
          POSPrinter       : POSPrinter
          LineDisplay      : LineDisplay
          MICR             : MICR
          CheckScanner     : CheckScanner
          CashDrawer       : CashDrawer
          MSR              : MSR
          Keylock          : Keylock
          ElectronicJournal: ElectronicJournal
      - The sample program shows an example(s) of control methods.
        Therefore, it does not guarantee the correct operations for 
        all the settings of all the devices.
    7) The location to save the log files
       The default location to save the trace log file and POSPrinter error 
       log files is as follows:
       Windows
          Windows 2000/XP/Embedded:
           <System Drive>:\Documents and Settings\All Users\EPSON\pos\tm\Trace
          Windows Vista or newer:
           <System Drive>:\ProgramData\EPSON\pos\tm\Trace
       Linux
        /var/epson_javapos/pos/trace
    8) The location to install the Library files (Linux only)
       The default install location for library files has been changed to the location indicated below.
       <Current>
        EPSON JavaPOS ADK 1.13.10 or older (32bit): "${JAVA_HOME}/lib/i386"
        EPSON JavaPOS ADK 1.13.10 or older (64bit): "${JAVA_HOME}/lib/amd64"
       <New>
        EPSON JavaPOS ADK 1.13.11 or later (32bit/64bit): "/opt/EpsonJavaPOS/bin"
       
       The location does not change, however, if the Java folder 
       ("${JAVA_HOME}/lib/ext") was selected in the Set User Classpath setting during installation.
    9) There is a problem in Java.
       http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6311057
       For the problem, if you change system time, please finish the application which uses JavaPOS
       before changing the system time.
