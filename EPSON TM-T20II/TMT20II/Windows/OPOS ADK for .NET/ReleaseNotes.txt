    http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/hh506443.aspx

5.2 Installation and uninstallation
    1) When installing the software, create a directory with the name
        "EPSON" in the following directory.

       Windows XP/Embedded:
         <System Drive>:\Documents and Settings\All Users\
       Windows Vista or newer:
         <System Drive>:\ProgramData\

       Temporary files and information files required by ServiceObject
       operations are saved in this "EPSON" directory. Do not delete the
       directory.

    2) Please restart your system after upgrade install When installing by silent
       from the older versions(Ver.1.11.20 - Ver.1.12)

5.3 Interface connection
5.3.1 Parallel connection
    1) We checked the performance of the program at LPT1.
    2) Please set "Bi-Directional" for either the ECP or EPP settings in the 
       parallel mode settings in the BIOS.
    3) Depending on the BIOS, there is a possibility of "ECP doesn't work but 
       EPP does work" or conversely "EPP doesn't work but ECP does work" 
       occurring. If it doesn't work properly, please change these settings 
       and try again.
    4) After turning the device off, there is a delay of several seconds 
       before the ServiceObject recognizes that the power is off. Please 
       consider in the application.
    5) In 64bit OS, the following devices are not supported.
       -TM-H5000II/TM-H5200/TM-J7000/TM-J7100/TM-J7500/TM-J7600/TM-U230/
        TM-U675/TM-U950

5.3.2 USB connection
     1) multiple models of the same type:
      If multiple models of the same type are used in USB connections at the 
      same time, settings must be configured manually(See "5.3.2.1 Procedure").
      Note that the procedure varies by model.

      - TM-H5000II/TM-H5200/TM-J7000/TM-J7100/TM-J7500/TM-J7600/TM-U230/TM-U675

5.3.2.1 Procedure
      1) Set the USB port setting [Port Name Type] to [Serial Number].
      2) Specify the USB serial number as the port name.
      
      The USB serial number is a serial number provided exclusively for USB.
      The USB serial number can be checked with the following procedure.

      - Perform a printer self-test print.
        Generally, if the printer is turned on with the printer cover closed
        and the FEED switch held down, self-test printing is performed on roll
        paper.
      - The serial number can be identified from the print results.
        When the print results are in format a), the part shown as "ID" is
        the USB serial number (in the example below YYYYYYYYYYYYYY is the
        serial number). When the print results are in format b), the USB
        serial number is the same as the printer serial number. In this case,
        check the label attached to the printer.

        a) When the USB serial number is printed
          ----------
              :
          Firmware Version X.XX ESC/POS

          Interface UB-UXXXX Ver.X.XX
           ID  :YYYYYYYYYYYYYY
              :
              :
          ----------

        b) When the USB serial number is not printed
          ----------
              :
          Firmware Version X.XX ESC/POS

          USB Interface or other
              :
              :
          ----------

          * "USB Interface or other" shown above may be printed simply as
            "USB Interface."

    Note that when setting the device using this method, changing a device
    with a different USB serial number, requires changing the SetupPOS
    settings.

    If the "Found new hardware wizard" is displayed when the printer is
    turned ON/OFF, cancel the wizard and install the EPSON Advanced Printer
    Driver (Version 4.50 or later).

5.3.3 Network connection
    1) We checked the performance of the program, connecting with a maximum of 
       20 printers via the network interface.
    2) Default guest account of OS and the Ethernet interface.
       Note: A known workaround is to not use the "Default" guest account,
             but to create and use another guest account.
    3) Please exercise caution to the following points when using the Network 
       Interface Device.
        - During use the OPOS.NET driver, the TM printer's power Off / On 
          operation is supported, but after it is turned On, it cannot be 
          guaranteed that it will reconnect, so exercise caution. During use 
          the OPOS.NET driver, that PC has a monopoly on its connection with 
          the TM printer. (Another PC cannot connect with it.) However, if the
          TM printer's power is turned OFF once, then turned On again, any PC 
          existing on the network can connect with that TM printer. At that 
          time, the OPOS.NET of a PC which is in the middle of a Claim will 
          attempt to reconnect automatically, but if another PC's OPOS.NET also
          attempts to make a Claim, it is not clear which will be able to make 
          the connection. The PC which is the earliest to request connection 
          can establish the connection. Accordingly, a TM printer which has had
          its power turned Off and On after Open and Claim, may not necessarily
          be available to reconnect to, so exercise caution.  When the TM 
          printer's power is turned On.
        - It can take up to maximun 20 seconds when turning on or resetting a
          TM printer, or using a network function.  Please wait for this
          interval to pass before starting any processing.

5.3.4 Bluetooth connection
    1) After turning off TM printer power, wait at least 20 seconds before 
       turning power back on. The printer will not print if power is turned 
       on before this time has elapsed.
    2) When the power supply of a printer is Off, if a Claim method is 
       performed,before a response will return, it will take 7 seconds or more.

5.4 Devices
5.4.1 POSPrinter
    1) Multi-tone printing:
       There are following two ways for gray scale printing:
       - PrintBitmap
         Set to "Multi Tone" from SetupPOS [Device Details]->[Gradation], or,
         Change the mode by DirectIO
         method (DI_SET_BITMAP_PRINTING_TYPE)
         For your information, white line might be seen in the print result when
         gray scale printing via serial or Ethernet interface. Also, printing
         speed might be slower.
       -NVRAM
         To register images in the NVRAM, it is necessary to register the image
         by the utility software at first, then print by DerectIO method
         (DI_PRINT_FLASH_BITMAP2).
    2) Data sent from the printer after OPOS.NET is used
       Device settings are overwritten once OPOS.NET is used.  Depending on this
       action, data could subsequently be sent from the device.  If you then 
       directly connect to the device without using OPOS.NET, please disregard
       the following data.
        - 3-byte printer status sent when the power is turned ON
        - 3-byte power ON notification sent when the power is turned ON

5.4.2 LineDisplay
    1) MarqueeRepeatWait and MarqueeUnitWait property:
       When setting MarqueeRepeatWait or MarqueeUnitWait below 300msec with DM-D30,
       it'll be 300msec.

5.5 Others
    1) Stand by/hibernation mode for the OS
       Since it is possible that the driver will become unstable if the 
       computer goes into stand by/hibernation mode while the printer is in 
       use, please avoid the use of stand by/hibernation mode.
    2) Sample program
      - When you use the sample program, the Logon ID needs to be the
        Administrator account group.
      - Register with the logical device name.

      - The sample program shows an example(s) of control methods.
        That is why, it does not guarantee the correct operations for
        all the settings of all the devices.
    3) The EPSON original constant is defined in the
       "Epson.opos.tm.common.dll."
       When using the EPSON original constant, add a reference to
       "Epson.opos.tm.common.dll" in the install directory.
    4) The logo utility (TMFlogo, etc.)
       The logo utility is not in this package. For uploading logo data to
       nonvolatile memory, please use SetBitmap method, or please obtain the
       logo utility.
    5) When using the tracing (log) function
       Tracing results are saved in the following directory.

       Windows XP/Embedded:
         <System Drive>:\Documents and Settings\All Users\EPSON\pos\tm\Trace
       Windows Vista or newer:
         <System Drive>:\ProgramData\EPSON\pos\tm\Trace
