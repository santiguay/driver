    +- Windows
       +- Advanced Printer Driver
           In addition to ordinary Windows driver functions, this
           driver has controls specific to POS, such as controls for
           paper cut, a cash drawer, or customer display. The
           Status API (Epson original DLL) that monitors printer
           status and sends ESC/POS commands is also
           attached to this driver.
       +- OPOS ADK
           This OCX driver can control POS peripherals using OLE
           technology. Because controlling POS peripherals
           with original commands is not required on the
           application side, efficient system development is
           possible.
       +- OPOS ADK for .NET
           OPOS ADK for .NET allows you to develop
           applications that are compatible with Microsoft POS
           for .NET.
           When developing applications, use a separate
           development environment such as Microsoft Visual
           Studio .NET.
       +- JavaPOS ADK
           JavaPOS is the standard specification which defines
           an architecture and device interface (API) to access
           various POS devices from a Java based system. Using
           JavaPOS standard API allows control with Java-based
           applications of functions inherent to each device. A
           flexible design with Java language and JavaPOS
           enables many different types of computer systems,
           such as stand alone or network configuration, to use
           a same application. You can use JavaPOS to build
           applications and drivers independently of platforms.
           This allows flexible configurations using thin clients to
           meet the system requirements.
       +- TM Virtual Port Driver
           This driver is a Serial-USB/Ethernet and Parallel-USB/
           Ethernet conversion driver to make an EPSON TM/BA/
           EU printer connected via USB/Ethernet accessible
           from a POS application through virtual COM ports
           and a virtual LPT port. Without making changes in the
           POS application that controls devices connected
           through serial or parallel interfaces, devices
           connected via USB/Ethernet can be directly
           controlled with ESC/POS commands.
       +- TM-T20II Utility
           Use for the following functions:
           - Checking current settings
           - Operation check
           - Storing logos
           - Coupon settings
           - Paper reduction settings
           - Automatic paper cut settings
           - Printing control settings
           - Font settings
           - Optional buzzer settings
           - Communication I/F settings
           - Backup/restore
       +- EpsonNet Config
           Use for IP address setting.
       +- Monitoring Tool
           Use to check a list of status for the Epson printers connected
           to the network. You can also update certificates for multiple
           printers used for WPA-Enterprise in a batch.
    +- Linux
       +- tmt-cups(Epson TM/BA Series Thermal Printer Driver)
           This driver allows you to control the TM-T20II using
           Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) on GNU/Linux.
           This is a full raster printer driver. It is able to print
           images, text, and vector graphics etc., that an
           application displays. With this driver many printer
           control are possible, such as paper cut timing control,
           cash drawer control, printing speed control, blank
           line skip, and upside-down printing.
       +- JavaPOS
          JavaPOS ADK Linux version.
    +- Mac
           Mac printer driver allows you to control the TM-T20II
           using Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) on Mac OS X.
           This is a full raster printer driver. It is able to print
           images, text, and vector graphics etc., that an
           application displays. With this driver many printer
           controls are possible, such as paper cut timing
           control, cash drawer control, printing speed control,
           blank line skip, and upside-down printing. It also
           provides API and dialogues for print setting, sample
           applications, and logo setting utility.
